- See the approximate reading time of their text
- Analyze the letter density of their text
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I learned how to use custom variants in Tailwind CSS. This allows you to create reusable styles that can be applied to multiple elements. For example, I created a custom variant for dark mode:

```css
@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
```
